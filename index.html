    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>Yoruba is a West African language spoken by approximately 47 million people worldwide. 
        Though its roots lie with the Yoruba people primarily residing in Nigeria, the language extends dialectically across several countries, including Benin, Togo, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Brazil, and The Gambia. 
        Despite this wide geographic and cultural reach, there exists a surprising lack of comprehensive online tools for learning, teaching, or documenting the Yoruba language. 
        A basic Google search for "Yoruba Dictionary" yields a handful of results—such as YorubaDictionary.com, Glosbe, and Lexilogos—yet each of these falls short in key areas that The Yoruba Dictionary aims to address.
        Many existing platforms lack essential search capabilities, rely heavily on Google Translate without independent linguistic verification, or do not support advanced features such as voice search through automatic speech recognition (ASR) or text-to-speech functionality in Yoruba. 
        This technological gap is likely due to the limited size of the existing Yoruba language corpus, which has impeded the development of robust ASR and text-to-speech models tailored to the language.
        I created <a href="https://yorubadictionary.yale.edu" target="_blank"></a>The Yoruba Dictionary</a>, a mobile-accessible and easily maintainable web application to support the learning of Yoruba using the formal vocabulary taught in Yale’s Yoruba language curriculum. 
        It is the culmination of a semester-long research project exploring the use of ASR and text-to-speech techniques to specifically serve the Yoruba language. While the ASR component for Yoruba voice search is not yet fully implemented, the platform is under active development and aims to evolve into a comprehensive resource for Yoruba language learners and researchers alike.
